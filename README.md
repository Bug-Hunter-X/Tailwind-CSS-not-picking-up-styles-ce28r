# Tailwind CSS - Styles Not Picking Up

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to components despite seemingly correct configuration.  The problem usually stems from an incorrectly configured `content` option within the `tailwind.config.js` file, leading Tailwind to miss specific files containing your component styles.

## Problem

The `tailwind.config.js` might incorrectly specify the paths for Tailwind to scan for class names within your project. This could cause the styles to not be included in your final CSS output.  The included `bug.js` demonstrates a common mistake where a file with the styles might be excluded.

## Solution

The correct `content` array should include all files where Tailwind classes are used. The `bugSolution.js` shows how to properly set the `content` array, ensuring that all your components' styles are correctly compiled.

This repository is for illustrative purposes to help developers quickly understand and fix this common Tailwind CSS error.
